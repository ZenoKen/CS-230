Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The Gaming Room was the customer. For Android, they have a game called Draw It or Lose It. The Gaming Room intended to improve the software's functionality and increase its platform support. This text was written in a straightforward, succinct, and to-the-point manner.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? I developed a detailed suggestion section for the client that included the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the advantages of launching the product using serverless architecture. I presented a compelling argument for why a cloud platform was the best option for the customer and their objectives.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? It helps you stay focused on the work at hand and select which chores are vital and which don't require your time and attention.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? Recommendations were difficult for me; I understand what is required and why in my thoughts, but it is difficult for me to articulate.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? I managed to break apart the game's functionality so that there would be less effort and time spent extending it to different operating systems. All while maintaining the game's integrity. Your customer may be the one who asks you to do the work, but the result is ultimately controlled by the users. If customers don't trust the program or have issues with it, they won't utilize it and won't buy anything else.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? To make updates and maintenance easier, I focused on comprehensive documentation and separating game and game required functions.
